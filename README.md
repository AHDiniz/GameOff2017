# GameOff2017
Unity game made for the Game Off 2017 Git Hub game jam

I know you guys prefer it to be an full open-sorce project, but I kinda' don't have enough time for learning a new tool,
so I'm making it on Unity.

BUT, since you got to try something new in a game jam, I'm trying to do the art assets by myself for the first time, 
always learning, right?
